# What you need to know after the first chapter of Quantitative Methods

The Time Value of Money (TVM) reading kicks off Quantitative Methods, which in turn holds the key to much of the financial calculations and methodology that undergird the rest of the curriculum. 

Understanding Reading 5 on TVM is vital because it introduces key concepts that remain relevant in multiple types of calculations.

In this post we'll quickly break down the key takeaways that you should walk away with after reading the section and some of the core areas you need to be prepared for on the CFA Level 1 exam.

### (1) The meaning of interest rates

What is an interest rate?

Know and be able to explain that the interest rate (r) can be interpreted as the required rate of return, the discount rate, or as an opportunity cost.

### (2) What components go into determining the interest rate?

The interest rate consists of several different risk factors (premiums) that we add up to find the overall interest rate. We usually break these different factors into the (a) risk free rate, (b) inflation, and (c) various other premiums that can include things like illiquidity and security specific factors. 

Those different risk premiums explain why the expected rate of return (*you remember that's one way to interpret the interest rate right!?*) varies for different asset classes. Finally, while it's only hinted at in this reading, you will eventually need a good understanding of the difference between the nominal and real interest rates as well.

### (3) Compound interest rates and how they link Present Value, and Future Value

The concept of present value and future value is essential. You won't get far in the CFA curriculum (or in finance) without understanding that money today is more valuable than money in the future. How much more valuable is determined by the compound interest rate and the amount of time between now and the future. 

The equation you'll need to memorize for the rest of your CFA life that models this relationship is ...

### (4) Indexing different cash flows to one point in time

Future value/present value calculations on the exam will attempt to layer in different levels of complexity into what looks like a basic calculation in order to make a given problem more difficult than a simple formulaic plug and play. A common example of this is requiring you to use the **cash flow additivity principle** to index different future values to a single point in time where they can be added together. Be confident in using a timeline to determine different net present values and add them up.

This becomes especially relevant with problems addressing annuities and annuities due. Once you have the intuition of when cash flows start and can successfully solve present value calculations for either of those securities you're well on your way to having this reading click. But getting there requires a lot of practice problems for most Candidates.

### (5) Dealing with Different Frequencies of Compounding

 You should be confident taking time periods and converting them to the relevant compounding periods and doing the same with given interest rates. 

*So if a problem gives you the interest rate as an annual number and the time in years, but the loan has quarterly compounding you would divide r by 4 to get your quarterly interest rate (I/Y) and you would multiply the number of years by 4 to get N.* 

 If you can't perform the conversions you'll input incorrect variables into the formula or your financial calculator and miss a lot of points. If you can, there's an entire set of equations dealing with different compounding frequencies you can ignore trying to memorize.

 Oh, and always remember that the __higher__ the interest rate or the __more time__ we are taking into consideration the __higher__ the FV of an investment will be.

### (6) Mastering your Financial Calculator 

This reading is the first introduction to your financial calculator. Being able to use it across functions will let you circumvent a lot of the formulaic memorization that often plagues L1 Candidates as they grapple with hundreds of different equations. At a bare minimum you should emerge from the EOC questions in this reading being able to toggle between BGN and END and navigating NPV, IRR, and uneven cash flow problems. This will not only up your chances of actually getting specific problems right, but will let you get to other problems more quickly (*and trust us for an exam where you need to answer 1 problem every 90 seconds saving time matters a lot more than you might think*).
