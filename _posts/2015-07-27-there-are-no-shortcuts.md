# There are no shortcuts to the CFA Exam
The hardest part of the CFA Level 1 process may just be getting started. It’s also the most important part.     

The CFA material is long (2,500+ pages for level 1 alone). It is detailed. It will take time to learn the material, understand the types of problems you’ll need to know how to answer, and then practice over and over until you get comfortable.  

That’s true even if you’ve worked in finance for 30 years. There are no real shortcuts. 

The gospel is that the average Candidate needs to study 300 hours to pass the test. It could be more or less for you. 

Our job here at [Go Study](www.cfaexamlevel1.com) is to make sure you learn everything you need to pass the test while minimizing that time commitment.  

That’s it. 

We’re all about quality and efficiency here ([just ask the 500+ level 3 Candidates we just helped)](www.cfaexamlevel3.com).  

Still, efficiency has limits. 

## Don't just start, Start mentally prepared
Passing all three Level 3 exams is a daunting challenge, and for your own sake you should be mentally prepared for that grind before you start Level 1. There are no prizes for being stuck as a CFA Level II Candidate.  You will make sacrifices with your time, there will be *opportunity costs*.

***It will take years.***

Still interested?

Good. 

The CFA curriculum will teach you something new. Its community is powerful, its designation recognized throughout the world. 

### We will help you walk the path
We know the pain of passing these tests. We’ve been where you are.  We are here to help. 

Your first step with us should be to register for our newsletter from our [home page](www.cfaexamlevel1.com). It’s completely free.

And just like we did with level 3, we’ll use our newsletter to release  hundreds of pages of our Level 1 notes to you for free as well as sharing tips, tricks, additional study resources, walk throughs of difficult problems, and much more.

Let's get started.
