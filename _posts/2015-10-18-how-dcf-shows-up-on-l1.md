# The 5 Things That Will be Tested from L1's Discounted cash flow readings
Without further delay let's break down the key themes from the discounted cash flow reading and how to apply them to answer likely exam questions.


## Solving NPV & IRR Problems Using your Financial Calculator **

__Solving NPV problems__

	1. ID all the benefits (inflows) and costs (outflows)
	2. Determine the right discount rate to use
	3. Discount each cash flow using the discount rate. When inputting the cash flows, inflows are positive and outflows are negative
	4. The NPV is the sum of each discounted cash flow (DCF).
	5. Make a decision on the capital budget project (i.e. is NPV > 0?)


__Solving NPV on your financial calculator__

To calculate NPV on your financial calculator you need to use the cash flow (CF) function.  First, you would clear all previous cash flows work by pressing ([CF][2nd][CLR WORK].

Then enter all of the sequential cash flows.


	* CF0 is in the initial outlay and will be a negative number for a corporate finance project
	* CF1 is the first period’s cash flow and so on and so forth. Remember to use net cash flows.
	* When you are done entering the cash flows, hit NPV and enter the interest rate for I=?
	* Key down and CPT the NPV

*Solve for IRR using your financial calculator*

The steps for entering cash flows are identical to NPV problems. The only difference is that we now hit [IRR][CPT] to calculate the IRR (and of course we are not asked to input an external interest rate).

## Being able to Compare/Contrast the use of NPV and IRR, especially when dealing with mutually exclusive projects

For a single project NPV and IRR will result in the same decision. Any project with a positive NPV will have an IRR > required rate of return and vice versa.

When facing mutually exclusive projects or projects with non-conventional cash flow patterns, however, NPV and IRR can give conflicting answers. This is a result of different initial costs and the timing of cash flows. The __sooner__ cash flows occur the __higher__ an IRR will be even if the ultimate NPV of that project ends up being lower.

## Navigating between Holding Period Return, Bank Discount Yield, Effective Annual Yield / Money Market Yield, and the bond equivalent yield

Be able to convert from one to the other and also know which yields the highest value. 

* The HPY is the total return if the investor holds the note until maturity
* The EAY is the annualized HPY which uses a 365 day/year and accounts for compounding
* The BDY is the annualized yield based on simple interest and 360 days/year.
