# 3 Month CFA L1 Game Plan

It's late September already and despite your best intentions you've barely made a dent in the CFA Level 1 material. Now you have thousands of pages of material left to read and only 15 weeks in which to cover everything AND have enough time to review and do mock exams.

We get it. If you are taking Level 1 in December your situation is far from ideal. But you've probably beat yourself up enough about not being far enough along in the process. We're not here to do that. 

We're here to present an ambitious but feasible schedule to get you through the material while doing enough practice problems and building in enough review to pass this test. *And if you're taking the exam in June you can either space out our suggested order, or not study at all until March and read this then :).*  

In the rest of the post we will 


* Illustrate what we think "studying" or covering a session really means
* Outline the schedule of readings to cover
* End by presenting some alternative methods to cram this material in

## What does it mean to Cover the Material?

We think there are some best practices for reviewing the study material.


* Read our Summary Notes for the given chapter
* Read the Curriculum or Detailed Third Party Notes. Spend more time on sections you're weak in.
* Optional: Create notecards as you read OR use our notecards/app to sneak in study time while commuting or during coffee breaks at work
* Complete all End of Chapter Questions in the CFA-I curriculum and/or third party notes. Review your answers immediately afterwards. Make a note of the page numbers for these questions and the questions you got wrong andt those that cover very important topics.
* The following week while advancing on new material use your notes, our summary notes, or notecards to hammer the previous week's concepts during your **marginal study time**

### Potential Issues with the Above Study Plan

In no particular order here are some potential modifications to consider:

* Cover the material faster so you have more cram time at the end. This schedule almost assumes the ability to dedicate 10-12 hours of study time per day for those last 10-14 days
* Skip Ethics and GIPS and save it for the end
* Spend less time with Economics and FRA. The key risk in the schedule above is encountering core concepts like Equity Valuation, Fixed Income, and even Derivatives and the newly increased-in-weight Portfolio Management section relatively late in the game
* With limited time you should consider reading 3rd party notes (ours are a supplement not a replacement) instead of the original CFA-I curriculum
* Start mock exams earlier to cover material. Even if you are unfamiliar you'll see problems ahead of encountering the section and be primed to learn them more efficiently
