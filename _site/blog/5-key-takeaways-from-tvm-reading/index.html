                    <h1 id="what-you-need-to-know-after-reading-the-first-chapter-of-quantitative-methods">What you need to know after Reading the first chapter of Quantitative Methods</h1>

<p>The Time Value of Money (TVM) reading kicks off Quantitative Methods. Rest assured that its placement at the beginning is not an accident. The lessons in this reading are crucially important to many of the financial calculations throughout the L1 curriculum and often are the last component of solving multiple types of calculations.</p>

<p>In this post we’ll quickly break down the key takeaways that you should walk away with after reading the section and some of the core testable areas you need to be prepared for on the CFA Level 1 exam.</p>

<h3 id="the-meaning-of-interest-rates">(1) The meaning of interest rates</h3>

<p>What is an interest rate?</p>

<p>Be able to explain that the interest rate can be interpreted as (a) the required rate of return, (b) the discount rate, or (3) as an opportunity cost and be able to define each of those.</p>

<h3 id="what-components-go-into-determining-the-interest-rate">(2) What components go into determining the interest rate?</h3>

<p>The interest rate consists of several different risk factors (premiums) that we add up to find the overall interest rate. We usually break these different factors into the (a) risk free rate, (b) inflation, and (c) various other premiums that can include things like illiquidity and security specific factors. In this section the equation we are given is:</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/Interest-rate-components.png" alt="Components of an interest rate for CFA Level 1" /></p>

<p>Those different risk premiums explain why the expected rate of return (<em>you remember that’s one way to interpret the interest rate right!?</em>) varies for different asset classes.</p>

<p>Finally, while it’s only hinted at in this reading, you will eventually also need a good understanding of the difference between the nominal and real interest rates.</p>

<h3 id="compound-interest-rates-and-how-they-link-present-value-and-future-value">(3) Compound interest rates and how they link Present Value, and Future Value</h3>

<p>The concept of present value and future value is essential. You won’t get far in the CFA curriculum (or in finance) without understanding that money today is more valuable than money in the future. Exactly how much more valuable is determined by the compound interest rate and the amount of time that passes between now and then.</p>

<p>The equation you’ll need to memorize for the rest of your CFA life that models this relationship is:</p>

<p><img src="/static/img/FV-and-PV.png" alt="Future Value, Present Value, and Compound Interest Rates" /></p>

<p><em>If that equation isn’t familiar yet go read <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/money/compound-interest.html">this article</a></em></p>

<h3 id="indexing-different-cash-flows-to-one-point-in-time">(4) Indexing different cash flows to one point in time</h3>

<p>Future value/present value calculations on the exam will attempt to layer in different levels of complexity into what looks like a basic calculation in order to make a given problem more difficult than a simple formulaic plug and play.</p>

<p>The most common way they do this is by requiring you to use the <strong>cash flow additivity principle</strong> to index different future values to a single point in time where they can then be added together. To handle this be confident in using a timeline to determine different net present values and add them up.</p>

<p>This becomes especially relevant with problems addressing annuities and annuities due. Practice those types of problems repeatedly. Why? First because they’ll be directly tested. Second, because once you have the intuition of when cash flows start and can successfully solve those present value calculations you know you’ve mastered this reading.</p>

<h3 id="dealing-with-different-frequencies-of-compounding">(5) Dealing with Different Frequencies of Compounding</h3>

<p>You should be confident taking time periods and converting them to the relevant compounding periods and doing the same with given interest rates.</p>

<p><em>So if a problem gives you the interest rate as an annual number and the time in years, but the loan whose PV you are solving for has quarterly compounding what do you do?</em> <strong>You would divide r by 4 to get your quarterly interest rate (I/Y) and you would multiply the number of years by 4 to get N.</strong></p>

<p>If you can’t perform that type of conversion you’ll end up inputting incorrect variables into the formula or your financial calculator and miss a lot of easy points. Plus if you can do that there’s also an entire set of equations dealing with different compounding frequencies you can ignore trying to memorize.</p>

<p>If nothing else always remember that the <strong>higher</strong> the interest rate or the <strong>more time</strong> we are taking into consideration the <strong>higher</strong> the FV of an investment will be.</p>

<h3 id="mastering-your-financial-calculator">(6) Mastering your Financial Calculator</h3>

<p>This reading is the first introduction to your financial calculator. Being able to use it across functions will let you circumvent a lot of the formulaic memorization that often plagues L1 Candidates as they grapple with hundreds of different equations. At a bare minimum you should emerge from the EOC questions in this reading being able to toggle between BGN and END and navigating NPV, IRR, and uneven cash flow problems. This will not only up your chances of actually getting specific problems right, but will let you get to other problems more quickly (<em>and trust us for an exam where you need to answer 1 problem every 90 seconds saving time matters a lot more than you might think</em>).</p>

<h4 id="recap">Recap</h4>

<p>So to summarize you need to walk away from the TVM reading knowing:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to interpret an interest rate</li>
  <li>What factors go into determining the interest rate</li>
  <li>How Present Value and Future Value are related</li>
  <li>Bringing multiple cash flows from the future back to today or vice versa</li>
  <li>Dealing with different compounding frequencies and manipulating the interest rate accordingly</li>
  <li>How to use that financial calculator you’ll fail without</li>
</ul>
